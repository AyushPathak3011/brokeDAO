## Inspiration
DAO stands for Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, it may sound very intimidating but in reality a DAO is just a community with a shared bank account. They are member-led communities where any new initiative has to be proposed by the members, who then vote on it to be either passed or rejected. The voting rights and rules around spending DAO funds are governed by a code aka smart contracts .

I am a believer in sharing of power and also an open source contributor, this falls right under the principles of a DAO and hence i wanted to make one for students and contributors worldwide.

## What it does
**brokeDAO** is for students who want to work on projects in the web3 space and build a community.

All **brokeDAO** members receive an NFT when they become a member, as the members contribute and propose ideas to the communities which lead to big innovations, with the help of **Revise** their membership NFTs change dynamically and show the stats of the user such as contributions made, ideas proposed and many more.

The aspect of dynamically changing NFTs using **Revise** and governance tokens which help members create and vote on proposals creates an incentive for the members to contribute and *BUIDL* the community.

## How we built it
To *BUIDL* **brokeDAO**, the most important part was creating the smart contracts which acts as a backbone for the community.

Using **thirdweb** I,

‚òëÔ∏è deployed my own custom erc20 token.

‚òëÔ∏èdeployed my own ERC-1155 NFT that people can mint to join the DAO.

‚òëÔ∏èdeployed my own governance contract + treasury.

## Challenges we ran into
Being new to Revise I faced challenges to integrate the technology in my project. But after spending some time with the docs I believe I can integrate **Revise** within my project in the future updates.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a dApp is one of the major achievements of this project.

## What we learned
Throughout the *BUIDL* process, I learned a lot.
- I learned how to use thirdweb technology to create solidity smart contracts.
- I used react and javascript to connect the smart contracts to my front-end.
- I learned how to host projects on vercel.

## What's next for brokeDAO
The next update of **brokeDAO** will include a **Revise** integration which will help create NFTs for the users.
